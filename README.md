# Efficient-FedRec
Python implementation for "Efficient-FedRec: Efficient Federated Learning Frameworkfor Privacy-Preserving News Recommendation"

## Introduction
Directly applying federated learning on news recommendation models will lead to high computation and communication cost on user side.
In this work, we propose Efficient-FedRec, in which we dicompose the news recommendation model into a large news model maintained on server and a light-weight user model computed on the user side.
Experiments on two public dataset show the effectiveness of our method.
